# Unity3d-Game-Development-and-Augmented-reality

In the 'ball game' the ball can be controlled with the arrow key(joystick).The ball gameobject is subjected to vectors which push it, the ball has to collect all the animated crystals and the number of collected crystals is displayed as 'Points' in the UI. Once all the crystals are collected 'You win' is displayed.

The same 'ball game' is converted to Markerless Augmented reality using unity3d with Vuphoria SDK.
